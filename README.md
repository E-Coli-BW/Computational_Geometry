Computational Geometry Course Assignments Code Repo
Repo includes codes for Assignments shown below:
# 1. ConvexHull: 
Three algorithms for finding Convex Hull
  1) Slow: O(n^3) Simple Brute Force Test;
  2) Medium: O(n^2) 
  3) Fast: O(nlogn) First order the points by X-coordinate, then check for validity in linear time;
# 2. Segments:
Find intersection points of a list of Segments you draw in the window
Use Sweepline algorithm

# 3. Polygon:
Find Complement and Union of two Polygons
After completing Complement and Union method, Difference, Intersection can be done using operations of Complement and Union
